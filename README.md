📚 Online Library Management System
The Online Library Management System is a web-based application developed using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL. It is designed to automate and streamline library functions such as managing books, users, and borrowing records through a secure and user-friendly interface.

🔧 Key Features:
User-friendly frontend interface developed using HTML and CSS.

PHP handles all server-side operations including form submission, authentication, and dynamic page generation.

MySQL database stores all records including books, admin credentials, issued books, and return logs.

A secure Admin Login System is provided to authenticate administrators.

Admins can add, update, delete books from the library database.

Book details such as title, author, category, availability status, and ISBN are stored and displayed dynamically.

The Admin Panel also provides an overview of user activity, pending requests, and inventory control.

Prevents duplication and provides validation for key operations.

Simplifies the process of issuing and returning books with proper logging.

Designed for small to medium educational institutions, libraries, or individual use.

📁 Admin Table (MySQL)
The admin table includes:

admin_id (Primary Key)

admin_pass

role (for future scalability, e.g., SuperAdmin, Librarian)

Admins can log in securely to manage all backend functionalities like managing books, reviewing issue requests, and maintaining overall library data integrity.

🚀 Technologies Used
Frontend:

HTML5 – for structuring web content

CSS3 – for styling and responsive layout

Backend:

PHP – for server-side scripting and database interaction

MySQL – for storing all library and user data

🛠️ How to Run the Project

Install XAMPP / WAMP / MAMP (any local server environment)

Place the project folder inside the htdocs directory (for XAMPP).

Start Apache and MySQL services from the control panel.

Open phpMyAdmin, create a database (e.g., library_db) and import the provided .sql file.

Navigate to http://localhost/your_project_folder/ in your browser.

Login using default admin credentials (set in the admin table of the database).
